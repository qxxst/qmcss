# qm.css
Extension of [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) that adds new styles, fonts, animations and more.
## Installation
To use qm.css, simply add the following line to your website's head:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/qxxst/qmcss@v1.6/qm.css">`

You can also replace the version number with `live` to get the latest version of qm.css, but this should not be used in production.

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/qxxst/qmcss@live/qm.css">`

qm.css automatically imports W3.CSS from w3schools.com, so there is no need to include it in the head or import it a second time.
